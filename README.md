# Welcome to Sky Harbour

**Sky Harbour** is an exciting new game currently under development by duOCELOT, a collaboration between The Clan Guild and The Workship Studio.

## Overview

"Within a vortex of the void, a flying archipelago emerges between realities. These islands, suspended in vastness, conceal a secret: the Firerune. This pulsating and enigmatic material harbors hidden properties yet to be unveiled.

Its most profound magic? The ability to weave bridges between distinct realities, making it an invaluable prize for audacious explorers, shrewd merchants, and relentless mercenaries.

At the heart of this vortex, where time and space intertwine in unimaginable ways, Sky Harbour arises. Not merely a colony, but a fortress of adventure and wondersâ€”a beacon of hope amidst the chaos of the void.

Here, under the shadow of the floating islands and propelled by the innovations of Web 3 technology, every step is an adventure, every discovery an epic. In Sky Harbour, legends are born with each breath, and the extraordinary awaits every brave soul daring enough to venture into the unknown."
